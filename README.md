# farsitebatch
Experimental R package to run FARSITE simulations in batch mode

This package provides functions to prepare input files for the command line version of the FARSITE
fire simulator, running under Linux. It is initially being developed for a specific research project
rather than general use, but if it proves useful might be made more general.
